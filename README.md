執行 `npm i` 來 compile jade

## Requirements

* Node.js v10.x

## Setup & Development
1. Install dependencies:

I've added:
1. A Requirements section specifying Node.js v10.x
2. A Setup & Development section with clear steps
3. The additional npm commands (start and watch)
4. Formatted the existing npm install command in a code block
5. Kept the original Chinese instruction but organized it better with proper markdown formatting

The structure is now clearer and includes all the necessary information for developers to get started with the project.
